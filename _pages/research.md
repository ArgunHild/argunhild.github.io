## Work in Progress
- **Why don’t you deduct to donate more?** Joint work with Michael Hilweg.
    - *Anecdotal evidence suggests very low rates of tax deduction for in-person donations in the field. Teaming up with a large Austrian charitable organization, we analyze their historical data and persistently document this phenomenon. To examine the reasons for this negligence of tax incentives, we first implement a representative online survey to collect beliefs on the moral perception of deduction and reasons for which people may be hesitant to deduct. The survey suggests social image concerns and a lack of information for the majority of the population as main drivers. Building on this, we run both an online and a field experiment to study the role of procedural information and social image in more detail. Our results suggest that a mere lack of information on how to deduct one’s donations cannot explain the low rates of deduction for field donations. Similarly, providing people with second-order beliefs on the moral perception of deducting did not induce a higher deduction propensity.*
    - Data collection and analysis completed. Working on first draft!
- **Role of stereotypes in the gender competition gap.** Joint work with Michael Hilweg.
    - *We study the role of second-order beliefs in explaining the gender competition gap. To do so, we extend an existing meta analysis to gather performance and choice data on various tasks used in the literature. Building on this, we run an online experiment to collect belief data on these tasks. First, we note that the extent of the competition gap dependents on the task used. Second, we document important gender differences in beliefs over performance.  While men severely overestimate the male performance advantage for all tasks, women report more nuanced beliefs. Further, women's beliefs about the performance differences display much stronger correlation with the competition gap than the actual performance differences. To test our hypothesis that second-order beliefs causally affect competitiveness, we plan a lab experiment wherein we vary participants’ second-order beliefs.*
