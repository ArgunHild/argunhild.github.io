## Working Paper Available Soon
- **Competing Against Stereotypes: Stereotyped Beliefs and Willingness To Compete.** Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *Career choice, earnings, and other key economic outcomes have been linked to gender differences in willingness to compete. We examine how gender stereotypes shape these differences. First, we conduct a meta-study of prior studies that have measured competitiveness in various domains. Gender competition gaps are larger in male-stereotyped domains, smaller or reversed in female-stereotyped domains, and, most notably, not explained by performance differences. To explore mechanisms, we collected belief data in an elicitation experiment. We find that stereotyped beliefs about gender performance differences explain more than half of the variation in competition gaps in the literature. In follow-up laboratory and online experiments, we manipulate stereotypes through framing and informational cues about others' beliefs. Although these interventions significantly shift beliefs, the effects are not strong enough to translate into changes in competitive behavior.*
- **Why Don’t Donors Deduct? Social Norms and the Limits of Tax Incentives.**  Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *Many donors leave tax benefits unclaimed even when claiming is almost costless. We test concise procedural instructions and a one-sentence norm cue in an online experiment, a door-to-door field experiment with address-level randomization, and a radio-based campaign spanning two Austrian federal states. While almost all donors deduct when giving through an anonymous online tool, only a select few do so during face-to-face fundraising. Qualitative findings from a representative survey point to confusion about filing steps and misperceived social norms as the main drivers of this gap. Across settings, procedural instructions alone leave deduction unchanged, whereas adding the norm cue lifts take-up by roughly eight percentage points in the door-to-door setting and is redundant online. Monetary incentives aimed at public-good provision may therefore under-perform when they conflict with misperceived norms or image concerns in socially observable settings, unless paired with norm-shaping campaigns.*
