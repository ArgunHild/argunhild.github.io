### <span style="font-size:1.5em;">(JOB MARKET PAPER)</span> **Competing Against Stereotypes: Stereotyped Beliefs and Willingness To Compete.**  
*Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.*
    - *Career choice, earnings, and other key economic outcomes have been linked to gender differences in willingness to compete. We examine how gender stereotypes shape these differences. We conduct a meta-study of prior work and demonstrate that the wide variation in gender competition gaps can be explained by stereotypes: Men enter competitions more in traditionally male-stereotyped domains, whereas in female-stereotyped domains, the gap is smaller or even reversed. Importantly, these differences are not explained by gender gaps in performance. To explore mechanisms, we collect belief data in an elicitation experiment. We find that stereotyped beliefs about gender performance differences explain more than half of the variation in competition gaps in the literature. In follow-up experiments, we manipulate stereotypes through framing and informational cues about others' beliefs. Although these interventions significantly shift beliefs, the effects do not translate into changes in competitive behavior. Our findings highlight the importance of stereotypes in shaping gender gaps in competitiveness while suggesting that shifting beliefs alone is unlikely to close these gaps without deeper or longer-term interventions.*
- **Why Don’t Donors Deduct? Social Norms and the Limits of Tax Incentives.**  Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *Many Austrian donors leave tax benefits unclaimed even when doing so requires minimal effort and yields meaningful financial rewards. Qualitative findings from a representative survey point to confusion about how to access these benefits and to misperceived social norms on the moral appropriateness of deducting donations as the main drivers of this gap. We test concise information on deductibility and a one-sentence norm cue in an online experiment (n = 483), a door-to-door field experiment with address-level randomization (n = 6,728), and a radio-based campaign spanning two Austrian federal states. We find that almost all donors deduct when donating through the anonymous online tool. By contrast, during face-to-face fundraising, where social-image concerns are salient, fewer than 1 in 100 donors choose to do so. Across settings, information on deductibility alone leaves deduction unchanged, whereas adding the norm cue increased take-up by 0.36 standard deviations in the door-to-door setting. Our findings show that financial incentives can falter when clashing with misperceived norms in social settings, unless paired with campaigns that reshape those norms.*
