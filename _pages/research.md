## Work in Progress
- **Competing Against Stereotypes: Meta-Study of Gender Differences in Competitiveness.** Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *The experimental literature on gender differences in competitiveness has published over 280 studies, each utilizing a particular real-effort task. We exploit the natural variation in task-specific gender stereotypes to examine how stereotypes shape gender differences in competitiveness. In our meta-study, we compile data on gender competition and performance levels from previous studies. In addition, we collect beliefs about performance differences through an online experiment (n=765). Our key finding is that stereotypical beliefs, rather than actual performance differences, explain the variation in gender competition gaps across tasks. In a followup laboratory experiment (n = 749), we manipulate stereotypes through framing and informational cues about others’ beliefs. These interventions shift stereotypical beliefs, but the changes are not large enough to affect gender differences in competitiveness.*

- **Why don’t you deduct to donate more?**  Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *Many donors leave tax benefits unclaimed even when filing is almost costless. Administrative records from Austria underscore the puzzle: a 2017 reform that automated reporting raised deduction take-up by only 0.6 percentage points (from 19.8%) and lowered the average claim. Donation context widens the gap: in data from a large national charity, 85% of anonymous online gifts are deducted, but only 0.5% of door-to-door gifts are declared. A representative survey identifies two frictions—confusion about the filing steps and misperceived norms, with respondents underestimating moral approval of deducting by 24 percentage points. We test concise procedural instructions and a one-sentence norm cue in two field settings. Neither message matters online, where take-up already exceeds 80%. Printed once in parish journals before a door-to-door drive, the combined message raises the number of deductors by 7.7%, whereas instructions alone have no effect.Monetary incentives aimed at public-good provision may therefore underperform when they conflict with misperceived norms or image concerns, unless paired with adequate norm-shaping campaigns.*

-  **Inequality as a constraint on (repugnant) markets.** Joint work with Jakob Schmidhäuser.
    <!-- - *Literature has established that third parties are opposed to certain transactions even when they impose no direct externalities on them. Such repugnant transactions are broadly viewed as a constraint on markets. While various reasons for the emergence of repugnance have been discussed, we propose economic inequality as an important channel. In our experiment, people judge 9 different economic transactions in two inequality and one equality treatment. We elicit the main dimensions of repugnance suggested by the literature as well as the willingness to ban each transaction. Our novelty is twofold. First, we are the first to study how inequality affects repugnance. Second, we establish the role of descriptive norms in the context of repugnance by eliciting beliefs about others' choices.*

- **Non-Standard Choice and Matching.** Joint work with Gian Caspari, Michael Hilweg-Waldeck, Manshu Khanna, Vincent Meisner.
    <!-- - *We study the impact of non-standard choice behavior on performance of matching mechanisms. We have planned a series of experiments to compare sequential mechanisms with different menu sizes and levels of choice complexity. By doing so, our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges presented by non-standard choice behavior and provide insights and potential strategies for enhancing mechanism performance. Furthermore, we plan to expand on the existing theoretical framework to incorporate our experimental findings.*

-  **Don’t hate your luck, hate its shape.** Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    <!-- - *We explore how the optimal contest size in winner-takes-all tournaments responds to the shape of noise parameter's (luck's) distribution. Our theory predicts that, when good/bad luck outcomes are more likely the equilibrium effort is increasing/decreasing in the contest size. Further, the contest size that maximizes the aggregate performance under when bad luck outcomes are more likely is smaller than when good luck outcomes are more likely. However, if the objective is to maximize best possible performance the reverse is true. The reason is that while a larger contest leads to lower efforts, the benefit of having more luck draws dominates in the latter case. We plan an online experiment to confirm our theory results.*
