## Working Paper Available Soon
- **Competing Against Stereotypes: Gender Stereotypes, Beliefs, and Willingness To Compete.** Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *The experimental literature on gender differences in competitiveness has published over 280 studies, each utilizing a particular real-effort task. We exploit the natural variation in task-specific gender stereotypes to examine how stereotypes shape gender differences in competitiveness. In our meta-study, we compile data on gender competition and performance levels from previous studies. In addition, we collect beliefs about performance differences through an online experiment (n=765). Our key finding is that stereotypical beliefs, rather than actual performance differences, explain the variation in gender competition gaps across tasks. In a followup laboratory experiment (n = 749), we manipulate stereotypes through framing and informational cues about others’ beliefs. These interventions shift stereotypical beliefs, but the changes are not large enough to affect gender differences in competitiveness.*
- **Why Don’t Donors Deduct? Social Norms and the Limits of Tax Incentives**  Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck.
    - *Many donors leave tax benefits unclaimed even when claiming is almost costless. We test concise procedural instructions and a one-sentence norm cue in an online experiment (n = 483), a door-to-door field experiment with address-level randomization (n = 6,728), and a radio-based campaign spanning two Austrian federal states. While almost all donors deduct when giving through an anonymous online tool, only a select few do so during face-to-face fundraising. Qualitative findings from a representative survey point to confusion about filing steps and misperceived social norms as the main drivers of this gap. Across settings, procedural instructions alone leave deduction unchanged, whereas adding the norm cue lifts take-up by roughly eight percentage points in the door-to-door setting and is redundant online. Monetary incentives aimed at public-good provision may therefore under-perform when they conflict with misperceived norms or image concerns in socially observable settings, unless paired with norm-shaping campaigns.*

## Work in Progress
-  **Inequality as a Constraint on (Repugnant) Markets.** Joint work with Jakob Schmidhäuser.
    <!-- - *Literature has established that third parties are opposed to certain transactions even when they impose no direct externalities on them. Such repugnant transactions are broadly viewed as a constraint on markets. While various reasons for the emergence of repugnance have been discussed, we propose economic inequality as an important channel. In our experiment, people judge 9 different economic transactions in two inequality and one equality treatment. We elicit the main dimensions of repugnance suggested by the literature as well as the willingness to ban each transaction. Our novelty is twofold. First, we are the first to study how inequality affects repugnance. Second, we establish the role of descriptive norms in the context of repugnance by eliciting beliefs about others' choices.*

- **Navigating Complexity: Dynamic Mechanisms and Algorithmic Assistance in Behavioral Market Design.** Joint work with Gian Caspari, Michael Hilweg-Waldeck, Manshu Khanna, Vincent Meisner.
    <!-- - *We study the impact of non-standard choice behavior on performance of matching mechanisms. We have planned a series of experiments to compare sequential mechanisms with different menu sizes and levels of choice complexity. By doing so, our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges presented by non-standard choice behavior and provide insights and potential strategies for enhancing mechanism performance. Furthermore, we plan to expand on the existing theoretical framework to incorporate our experimental findings.*

<!-- -  **Don’t Hate Your Luck, Hate Its Shape.** Joint work with Michael Hilweg-Waldeck. -->
<!-- - *We explore how the optimal contest size in winner-takes-all tournaments responds to the shape of noise parameter's (luck's) distribution. Our theory predicts that, when good/bad luck outcomes are more likely the equilibrium effort is increasing/decreasing in the contest size. Further, the contest size that maximizes the aggregate performance under when bad luck outcomes are more likely is smaller than when good luck outcomes are more likely. However, if the objective is to maximize best possible performance the reverse is true. The reason is that while a larger contest leads to lower efforts, the benefit of having more luck draws dominates in the latter case. We plan an online experiment to confirm our theory results.*
