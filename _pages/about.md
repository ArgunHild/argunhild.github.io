I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Mannheim, primarily working in Behavioral and Experimental economics. My current research focuses on how beliefs (as well as meta-beliefs) shape economic behavior. Currently, I am working on topics related to gender differences in willingness to compete and charitable giving.


**I am on the 2025-2026 Job Market.**
