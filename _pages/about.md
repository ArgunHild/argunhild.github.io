I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Mannheim. My research examines how social and cognitive biases shape economic behavior and how targeted interventions can correct resulting market inefficiencies. I work at the intersection of behavioral and experimental economics, labor, and political economy. Currently, I study gender differences in willingness to compete and charitable giving.

**(Job market paper) Competing Against Stereotypes: Stereotyped Beliefs and Willingness To Compete.** With Michael Hilweg-Waldeck. [Draft](/assets/files/papers/JMP_Competing_Against_Stereotypes.pdf)
    - *Career choice, earnings, and other key economic outcomes have been linked to gender differences in willingness to compete. We examine how gender stereotypes shape these differences. We conduct a meta-study of prior work and demonstrate that the wide variation in gender competition gaps can be explained by stereotypes: Men enter competitions more in traditionally male-stereotyped domains, whereas in female-stereotyped domains, the gap is smaller or even reversed. Importantly, these differences are not explained by gender gaps in performance. To explore mechanisms, we collect belief data in an elicitation experiment. We find that stereotyped beliefs about gender performance differences explain more than half of the variation in competition gaps in the literature. In follow-up experiments, we manipulate stereotypes through framing and informational cues about others' beliefs. Although these interventions significantly shift beliefs, the effects do not translate into changes in competitive behavior. Our findings highlight the importance of stereotypes in shaping gender gaps in competitiveness while suggesting that shifting beliefs alone is unlikely to close these gaps without deeper or longer-term interventions.*
