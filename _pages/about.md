I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Mannheim, primarily working in Behavioral and Experimental economics. I am also a researcher at the Market Design unit, ZEW Mannheim. I did my masters at the Central European University, Budapest (now Vienna) where I also worked as a research assistant.
